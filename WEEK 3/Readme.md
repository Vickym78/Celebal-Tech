# Async File Operations with Node.js

This project demonstrates how to perform asynchronous file operations in Node.js using Promises and the async/await syntax for better readability and error handling.

## Project Structure

- `app.js`: Contains the code for reading from `input.txt` and writing to `output.txt` using Promises and async/await.
- `input.txt`: An example input file that the script reads from.
- `output.txt`: The file where the content from `input.txt` will be written.


## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the `app.js` file and the `input.txt` file.
2. Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
